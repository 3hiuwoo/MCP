##### Todo List

- [ ] Implement **CLOCS**, run experiments using the same processed dataset as **COMET** uses.

- [ ] Run **COMET** for 5 seeds to complement experiments.

- [ ] Run **COMET** with only patient loss.

- [ ] Run **MCP** with only patient loss.

- [ ] Add **MCP** mechanism to **CLOCS**.

- [ ] Implement **ISL**, run experiments using the same processed dataset as **COMET** uses.

- [ ] Try Time-Frequency augmentation to **CLOCS**.

- [ ] Try remove momentum encoder in losses other than the patient and trial loss.

- [ ] Implement more dataset: CINC2017, PTB, PTB-XL
